# Ferry for Filament

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/phpinnacle/ferry.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/phpinnacle/ferry)

Ferry adds a data source connections section to the admin panel: administrators can create, edit, test, enable/disable and delete connections to 1C databases, and Ferry keeps a local snapshot of each source structure that later drives synchronization setup. Creating synchronizations and field mapping are out of scope for this package.

## Features

- `Connection` model with an encrypted password that is never returned to the interface.
- `ConnectionTester` service that opens a temporary connection with the current (possibly unsaved) form values, runs a lightweight query and reports a sanitized result.
- Queued structure preparation built on `phpinnacle/rosetta`, storing the semantic 1C metadata as `ConnectionMetadata` records.
- Filament `ConnectionResource` with create/edit/list pages, "Test connection" and "Fetch structure" actions, a structure status badge and driver-based default port suggestion.
- Policy-backed connection management (`ConnectionPolicy`), custom database connection and optional tenancy.

## Installation

```bash
composer require phpinnacle/ferry
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="phpinnacle-ferry-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

Register `FerryPlugin::make()` in the target Filament panel. Publish `phpinnacle-ferry-config` when using a non-default database connection, tenant model or timeout. Structure preparation runs on the queue, so a worker must be running.

## Source structure

Creating a connection, or changing any of its credentials, starts a new preparation run: the connection switches to `StructureStatus::Preparing` and `PrepareStructureJob` is dispatched after the database transaction commits. Only the connection id and the run id travel through the queue; credentials never do.

The run reads the source in bounded chunks and writes them into a draft revision. The published snapshot is replaced only once the whole draft is complete, so a failed refresh never damages the previous one. A source without Rosetta-supported objects is a valid empty snapshot.

```php
use PHPinnacle\Ferry\Enums\StructureStatus;
use PHPinnacle\Ferry\Models\Connection;

$connection = Connection::query()
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->where('status', StructureStatus::Ready)
    ->firstOrFail();

foreach ($connection->publishedMetadata()->get() as $object) {
    $object->kind;       // PHPinnacle\Rosetta\Enums\MetadataKind
    $object->system;     // array<string, PHPinnacle\Rosetta\Contracts\Field>
    $object->properties; // list<PHPinnacle\Rosetta\Data\MetadataProperty>
    $object->values;     // list<PHPinnacle\Rosetta\Data\EnumerationValue>
    $object->children;   // document tabular sections
}
```

`publishedMetadata()` returns the root objects of the published revision; use the `metadata()` relation to reach every stored revision. `is_active` states whether the connection may be used at all, while `status` only reports whether its local structure is ready.

When a run fails for good, the connection switches to `StructureStatus::Failed`, keeps its previous snapshot, stores a sanitized description in `last_error` and reports the original exception through `report()`. An interrupted run that stops sending heartbeats is retired on the next preparation attempt.

## Configuration

`phpinnacle-ferry.structure` tunes the preparation pipeline: `chunk_size` root objects per job, the job `timeout`, the retry `backoff` delays, and `stale_after` seconds before a silent run is considered interrupted.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
